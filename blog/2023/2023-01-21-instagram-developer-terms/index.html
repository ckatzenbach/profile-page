<p>Instagram <a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/8382111323ecfa8120c8fcdcad959040fa6cc994" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">changed</a> the inactivity period for developer accounts, after which it will <strong>suspend or end access</strong> to the platform’s APIs and other functions “with or without notice.” The inactivity period has now been reduced <strong>from 90 to 28 days</strong>.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for the shortening of the allowed inactivity might be due to <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2019/04/25/api-updates/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Meta’s ongoing measures for privacy and security</a>, which include regular re-evaluation of policies and data access. In case of data access expiry due to inactivity, developers are able to <strong>file for an app-review to regain access</strong>.</p>

<p>Instagram’s Graph, Messenger and Basic Display APIs allow users access data for professional and non-professional accounts to reach a wider Instagram audience.</p>
