<p>Twitter<a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/c74c9d84933b881150d24c0a09776da04c5da111" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> introduced</a> an update regarding the use of third-party apps, which are part of its developer terms. Based on the update, Twitter cuts off API (Application Programming Interface) access to third-party apps, which give you the option to scroll your feed and interact.</p>

<p>In the second section of the Developer Terms, Twitter has classified “using or accessing the Licensed Materials to create or attempt to create a substitute or similar service or product to the Twitter Applications” as reverse engineering and other restrictions.</p>

<p>Earlier last week, Twitter informed that it was<a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1615405842735714304" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> “enforcing long-standing API rules”</a> and that led to some applications not working. However, they did not explain what rules developers were violating. The developers have been very critical of this decision, which they defined as unprofessional and representing<a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/twitter-intentionally-ends-third-party-app-developer-access-to-its-apis/#:~:text=Twitter%20Intentionally%20Ends%20Third-Party%20App%20Developer%20Access%20to%20Its%20APIs,-By%20John%20Voorhees&amp;text=Late%20yesterday%2C%20The%20Information%20reported,app%20access%20to%20its%20APIs." rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> “an irretrievable breach of trust between it and its developers and users”</a>.</p>

<p>Since Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, the social network’s corporate policies and activities have changed dramatically in several ways. Twitter had also<a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/twitter-implements-new-rules-banning-links-to-other-social-platforms/639047/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> announced</a> that it would ban all links to other social platforms, with the intention of eliminating free promotion in favour of its competitors. Twitter removed that change due to a large amount of criticism. However, this raises the question of whether Elon Musk does not welcome other platforms using Twitter for their own purposes.</p>
