<p>TikTok <a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/6d1406cb8d73b34ff3f1281a04955ea93a097aa6" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">introduced</a> an update regarding the live stream policies to its community guidelines. **According to the update, the age limit for hosting a live stream is raised from 16 to 18. **From November 23, the account holders must be over 18 years old to be able to host a live stream on TikTok.</p>

<p>In the old version of the regulations, it was indicated that “their content is not eligible to appear in the For You feed (the age thresholds may be higher in some regions).” Accompanied by the update in the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines#31" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Minor Safety regulations</a>, this localized policy has been removed too. TikTok <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/enhancing-the-live-community-experience" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> that the platform is planning to introduce another feature that allows users to only reach an adult audience in their live streams.</p>

<p>The platform shared this update on its blog and said that the platform constantly works for improvements to protect users. Yet, BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63262102" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">highlighted</a> that the platform modified the rules after <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-63213567" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BBC’s investigation</a> on TikTok profiting from live streams of begging families at Syrian refugee camps.</p>
