<p>Youtube <a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/c24fa29ef2256297b0aa073a6df82f2d8e9a4dce" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">introduced</a> new criteria regarding the contents that hold age-restriction to its community guidelines. <strong>According to the update, age-restriction can be applied based upon the video titles, video descriptions, live streams, songs, clips etc.</strong></p>

<p>The regulations contained criteria based on only the videos or clips before the update. With these changes, age-restriction can be applied to contents regardless of the videos’ context, since Youtube claims in the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801964?hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">policies</a> as follows “This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.”</p>

<p>Along with the changes in the policy for age-restricted content, the language for the content moderation in the community guidelines has also been transformed to a more comprehensive one. The platform began to use the word “content”, instead of “video” in some cases such as “Use of excessive profanity in the content”.</p>
