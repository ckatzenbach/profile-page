<p>Twitch has <a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/69f34bdcb4edc037315f12b2f157e117754275fa" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">elaborated the scope of legal obligations and user data treatment</a>. In particular, the revisited policy states that the users’ agreement to allow the defined treatment of data will be <strong>documented</strong>. It is also now stated that upon registration to the platform and upon interaction with platforms services and features, users provide an <strong>extensive list of personal information</strong>, including voice, image, billing information, address and phone number.</p>

<p>As per the legal obligations: conditions, such as “monitoring and analysing the use of Twitch services,” “investigating and defending ourselves against third-party claims” are now considered by Twitch as <strong>sufficient grounds for documenting users’ consent</strong>. The revisited terms apply to all Twitch Interactive, Inc. applications and services.</p>
